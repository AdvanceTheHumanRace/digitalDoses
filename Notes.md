My game: Our Story Story
Using Instagram stories to 
- Game Goals: Harness the power of free writing to understand ourselves

  - Ground positive human connection into reality
- Phase 1 Our Free Story Free writing together to tell our collective story and preserve it as a digital anthology

My project: The Medicine Cabinet
A respository of sound, color and word art from experimental to fine, where artists can mix and match for endless fractals of collaborative creation. Work will be main categorized by sound, color, and word each with subs. Creators can create, buy, sell, connect, promote. Online and virtual events faciitated by contributing creators and paid through community tip jar. Exs, writing workshop, AI course
  *This could easily grow into any 'alternative' method of achieving resonance - kind of like my original app idea
  Phase 2 The repository becomes a physical space for creation connection and resonance (not including details here)

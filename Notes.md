# Notes
My game: Our Story Story
Using Instagram stories to DO SOMETHING
- Game Goals: 
  - Harness the power of free writing to understand ourselves
  - Increased connection through vulnerability and greater self awareness
  - Transform the energy of social media
  - Ground positive human connection into reality
- Phase 1 Our Free Story Free writing together to tell our collective story and preserve it as a digital anthology
- Phase 2-4 Our Word Story, Our Sound Story, Our Color Story 9 (these could launch simultaneously)

My project: The Medicine Cabinet
A respository of sound, color and word art from experimental to fine, where artists can mix and match for endless fractals of collaborative creation.
  - Work will be main categorized by sound, color, and word each with subs.
  - Creators can create, buy, sell, connect, promote.
  - Online and virtual events faciitated by contributing creators and paid through community tip jar. Exs, writing workshop, AI course *This could easily grow into any 'alternative' method of achieving resonance - kind of like my original app idea
- Phase 2 transition to physical space
  - Built on principles of biogemoetry
  - Afforable artist housing including work/live units
  - Equipment and education 
  - Onsite gallery
  - Recording studio mixed use rent to public and community benefit
  - Onsite food forrest, garden and agricultural education
  - Community kitchen (think clubhouse style) for mixed use by residents and community, rent to public for revenue
